# CryptoClustering

## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we were tasked to use our knowledge of Python and concepts of unsupervised learning to predict effects of price changes on crytocurrencies. The two scenarios we tested in this challenge are if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour price changes and 7-day price changes.

Two methods were used in this challenge, clustering using a scaled dataframe and clustering using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Overall, the PCA method resulted in less clusters, which led to wider range of predictions (not as accurate).

The python code used for this challenge can be found in the file "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb". The CSV file used to pull the data can be found in the "Resources" folder under "crypto_market_data.csv".
